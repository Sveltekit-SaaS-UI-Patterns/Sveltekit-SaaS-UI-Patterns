# Not Too Low Level, Not Too High Level
UI libraries tend to be pretty low level. They have components such as button, field, etc. The project aims to implement sementic templates and high order components / templates / patterns.

# Organization
Templates are organized by the context. For example, a form on a landing page will look and behave differently than a form inside an application

# Intended Audience
Right now, just for me :) But feel free to use.
